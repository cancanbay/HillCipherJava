This is the implementation of <b>Hill-Cipher</b> encryption via Java language.

Program has 2 options, encryption and decryption by Hill-Cipher.

If you just want to see the encryption or decryption matrix (key) input word does not matter.
<p></p>
<p>To run the program:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Run Main.java, type 1 for encryption 2 for decryption and then enter the word and 2x2 hill-cipher matrix' elements.</li>
</ul> 
If option is decryption and one or more elements of matrix' that does not have <b>inverse values at modulo 26</b>, program outputs decryption key is not allowed to decrypt that text.
